# Create a list of all of the things I need to pack for SaS.
# Figure out a way to randomly generate one thing every time I hit enter.
# I pack whatever pops up. After it pops up, I enter True or False for whether I packed it or not.
# If True, have the item be taken off of the list. If False, have the item be shuffled back in.
